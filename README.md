# UFOs

## Project Overview Analysis

The JavaScript which is the language of the web was put into graeter use in this webpage with lots of table filters.These filters were applied on the city, state, country and shape to add extra funtions and customizations which will enhance user experience.
The articles from the information are to be designed in an appeling manner to enable users find information. A very beautiful data visualization will allow those with limited data literacy interprete data with ease.

We will use JavaScript to create tables that organizes UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript list or array.

## Project Resource Coding Tools

1. We are using Visual Studio Code a source-code editor for testing, debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
2. GitHub
3. Design, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML (convert a Javascript array into an HTML Table)

## Project Deliverables

Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

## Results

A webpage was created to improve the user -friendly display of Ufo sighting data with a filter table that allows users to easily filter on variuos criteria including but not limited to date, city, state, and shape. Below is a UFO Sightings web design unfiltered:
