# UFOs

## Project Overview Analysis

The JavaScript which is the language of the web was put into graeter use in this webpage with lots of table filters.These filters were applied on the city, state, country and shape to add extra funtions and customizations which will enhance user experience.
The articles from the information are to be designed in an appealing manner to enable users find information. A very beautiful data visualization will allow those with limited data literacy interprete data with ease.

We will use JavaScript to create tables that organizes UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript list or array.

## Project Resource Coding Tools

1. We are using Visual Studio Code a source-code editor for testing, debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
2. GitHub
3. Design, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML (convert a Javascript array into an HTML Table)

## Project Deliverables

Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

## Results

A webpage was created to improve the user-friendly display of Ufo sighting data with a filter table that allows users to easily filter on variuos criteria including but not limited to date, city, state, and shape. Below is a UFO Sightings web design unfiltered:

Below is a filter results in a more narrowed view such as specifying the date, a city in one state and focusing on one type of shape such as light.!

Filter selection can be broad such as only selecting a country and state like the United States, California.There is no needed Submit or Refresh button as the tables update in real time.

## Summary

Our current webpage has one main advantage in that users can search upon multiple criteria at one time and there is no submit button needed. However, there are also some drawbacks. The main draw backs all have to do with the fact that the search options don't provide much idea as to available options to search on. The current fields are all text boxes and these can allow for a lot of user errors or just simply misinterpretation. This makes the data analysis ineffective and time consuming.

Drawback:
The filter method is case sensitive. Therefore if a user entered any items in upper case, the search results would not return properly. For example, if the user entered a city as "Ventura" instead of "ventura", the city would not return in the filtered data.

Recommendations:
Calendar selection option instead of textbox field for the Date search.
A drop down menu should be added for the shaor field.
